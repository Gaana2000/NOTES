# Vulnerability Checking Tools 

In information technology, a vulnerability evaluation is the systematic analysis of security vulnerabilities. It examines if the system is vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities, defines severity levels to such vulnerabilities, and, if and whenever appropriate, recommends abatement or mitigation.
In any device that fixes possible vulnerabilities, vulnerability testing or vulnerability evaluation is a systematic method of discovering security loopholes.

Here, we have some examples of threats that vulnerability assessment can eliminate are:

• SQL injection, XSS or other attacks with code injection.

• Privilege escalation is caused by faulty user authentication.

• Unprotected defaults, such as a discoverable admin password, are applications that arrive with vulnerable configurations.


# Tools


1. **OpenVAS**

**OpenVAS** is a valuable tool for detecting vulnerabilities that endorses massive scale scans that are appropriate for companies. This tool can be used not only in web applications or application server, but also in databases, programming systems, networks, and virtualization software to diagnose vulnerabilities problems.
OpenVAS provides frequent updates, which widens the exposure of vulnerability detection. It also assists in assessing the risk and demonstrates preventive measures for the identified vulnerabilities.

2. **Netsparker**

Netsparker is also a vulnerability assessment tool for web applications with an optimization feature provided for vulnerability seeking. This tool is also smart enough to find vulnerabilities within the next few hours in millions of web application domains.
It has many additional features, but it is a charged enterprise-level vulnerability tool. It has slithering innovation that, through crawling into the system, discovers vulnerabilities. Netsparker will identify and recommend mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities reported. Also, security tools are available for comprehensive vulnerability evaluation.

3. **Nmap**

Among many cybersecurity experts, Nmap is one of the possibly the best-known, freely used and open-source testing tools for networks. To explore hosts in the domain and for software exploration, Nmap uses the penetrating technique.
In two or more distinct networks, this function aims to detect exploits. If you really are a beginner or trying to learn to search for vulnerabilities, then the Nmap scanning tool is a great starting point.

4. **W3AF**

W3AF is a platform also called Web Software Attack and Framework, open and free-source. This software is an open-source web application analysis for vulnerabilities. By identifying and evaluating the bugs, it provides a mechanism that is useful to protect the web application. This software is recognized for user-friendliness. W3AF also has infiltration services used for vulnerability assessment work, along with penetration testing options.
W3AF contains a broad-scale set of vulnerabilities. This tool can be selected for networks that are attacked repeatedly, particularly with previously unrecognized vulnerabilities.


5. **GoLismero**

GoLismero is a tool used for intrusion prevention that is free and open-source. GoLismero aims to identify web application threats and vulnerabilities, but can also search for network vulnerabilities. GoLismero is an efficient tool that works with outcomes obtained by other vulnerability tools such as OpenVAS, then consolidates the findings and gives feedback.
A broad variety of vulnerabilities, including storage and network vulnerabilities, are protected by GoLismero. GoLismero also supports preventative measures for discovered vulnerabilities.
