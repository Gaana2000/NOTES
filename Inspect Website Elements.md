# INSPECTING WEBSITE ELEMENTS

Inspect Elements is a built-in web development tool found in most web browsers that allows real-time viewing and editing of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of a website. It helps to better understand how a webpage is constructed, as well as diagnose and debug issues, such as mixed content.To inspect your website's elements, you can use the element inspection tool. 

● There's a powerful tool hiding in your browser: **Inspect  Element**.

● Right-click on any webpage, click Inspect, and you'll see the innards of that site: its source code, the images and CSS that form its design, the fonts and icons it uses, the JavaScript code that powers animations, and more. You can see how long the site takes to load, how much bandwidth it used to download, and the exact color in its text.

● Or, you could use it to temporarily change anything you want on the page.
Inspect Element is a perfect way to learn what makes the web tick, figure out what's broken on your sites, mock up what a color and font change would look like, and keep yourself from having to Photoshop out private details in screenshots.


# How to Inspect Google Chrome?

Right-click on an empty area of the website or choose an element, and click on **Inspect**. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+I**, which will open all the development tools. You can check the **Elements** tab to inspect elements or the **Console** tab to detect any errors or warnings.

There are a few ways to access Google Chrome Inspect Element. Just open a website you want to try editing (to follow along with this tutorial, open the Zapier blog post "What is AI?"), then open the Inspect Element tool in one of these three ways:

**Method 1**

Right-click anywhere on the webpage, and at the very bottom of the menu that pops up, click Inspect.

**Method 2**

Click the hamburger menu (the icon with three stacked dots) on the far-right of your Google Chrome toolbar, click More Tools, then select Developer Tools. 

**Method 3**

Prefer keyboard shortcuts? Press command + option + I on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + C on a PC to open Inspect Element without clicking anything.

* Once you take your preferred route to opening the Developer Tools panel, by default, it will show the Elements tab—that's the famed Inspect Element tool we've been looking for.

* If you want to change the orientation of the Inspect Element panel, click the three vertical dots on the top-right side of the Inspect Element pane near the "X" (which you'd click to close the panel). Now, you'll see options to move the panel to the bottom, left, or right side of your browser or to open the pane in a completely separate window (undock view).

* Let's dock the panel on the right side of our browser window to give us more space to work. You can make the Developer Tools panel wider or narrower by hovering over the left-side border. Once the ↔ cursor appears, drag the panel left to widen it or right to narrow it.



**Tools you can access through Inspect Elements**

**Elements, and Emulation tabs**. These aren't the only useful tools Inspect Element opens up—not by a long shot—but they're extremely helpful ones that for Beginners. 

# What we can do with Inspect ?

● **Use Inspect Element Search to find anything on a site**.

● **Change anything with Elements**.


● **Change the text on a webpage**.


● **Change the color and font of elements**.


● **Change Element States**.



● **Change images**.



**Test a site on any device with Emulation**

▪ Everything has to be responsive today. Websites are no longer only viewed on computers—they're more likely than ever to be viewed on a phone, tablet, TV, or just about any other type of screen. You should always keep that in mind when creating new content and designs.

▪ **Emulation is a great tool to approximate how websites will look to users across various devices, browsers, and even locations. Though this does not replace actual testing on a variety of devices and browsers, it's a great start**.

▪ In the Developer Tools panel, you'll notice a little phone icon in the top-left corner. Click it. This should change the page into a tiny, phone-styled page with a menu at the top to change the size.

▪ Resize the small browser to see how things would look if you were browsing on a tablet, phone, or even smaller screen. Or, click the menu at the top to select default device sizes.

▪ The webpage screen should shrink down to the device's size, and you can zoom in a bit by clicking the percentage dropdown next to the dimensions.

▪ If you change the device preset to **Responsive**, you can enlarge the view by dragging the right edge of the webpage emulation right. See what happens? Dragging the screen along the grid allows you to see how the webpage will change as the screen size changes. You can even toggle portrait and landscape views by clicking the little rotation icon at the end of the top menu.

▪ Play around with the other devices to see how the webpage and screen resolution changes. All of the other developer tools we've gone over so far will also react to the device view.
