# Networking 

* Networking, or computer networking, is the process of connecting two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers or applications, to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources.
The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate. Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device.

•Open system: A system that is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 

•Closed system: A system that is not connected 
to the network and can’t be communicated with.


# Uses of Computer Networks


° Communicating using email, video, instant messaging, etc.

° Sharing devices such as printers, scanners, etc.
Sharing files.

° Sharing software and operating programs on remote systems.

° Allowing network users to easily access and maintain information.


# Types of Computer Networks


# Personal Area Network (PAN)

PAN is the most basic type of computer network. It is a type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person. It allows your personal devices, like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables, to communicate and share data with each other. PAN offers a network range of 1 to 100 meters from person to device providing communication. Its transmission speed is very high with very easy maintenance and very low cost. This uses Bluetooth, IrDA, and Zigbee as technology. Examples of PAN are USB, computer, phone, tablet, printer, PDA, etc.


**Types of PAN**

• **Wireless Personal Area Networks** - Wireless Personal Area Networks are created by simply utilising wireless technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth. It is a low-range network.

• **Wired Personal Area Network** -  A wired personal area network is constructed using a USB.


**Advantages of PAN**

•PAN is relatively flexible and provides high efficiency for short network ranges.

• It needs easy setup and relatively low cost.

• It does not require frequent installations and maintenance.

• It is easy and portable.

• Needs fewer technical skills to use.


 **Disadvantages of PAN**

• Low network coverage area/range.

• Limited to relatively low data rates.

• Devices are not compatible with each other.

• Inbuilt WPAN devices are a little bit costly.


# Local Area Network (LAN)


LAN is the most frequently used network. A LAN is a computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally. A LAN encompasses two or more computers connected over a server. The two important technologies involved in this network are Ethernet and Wi-fi.  It ranges up to 2km & transmission speed is very high with easy maintenance and low cost. Examples of LAN are networking in a home, school, library, laboratory, college, office, etc.


 **Advantages of a LAN**

•Privacy

•High Speed

•Supports different transmission mediums

•Inexpensive and Simple


 **Disadvantages of LAN**


• The initial setup costs of installing Local Area Networks is high because there is special software required to make a server.

• Communication devices like an ethernet cable, switches, hubs, routers, cables are costly.

• LAN administrator can see and check personal data files as well as Internet history of each and every LAN user. Hence, the privacy of the users are violated.

• LANs are restricted in size and cover only a limited area

• Since all the data is stored in a single server computer, if it can be accessed by aunauthorized user, can cause a serious data 
security threat.


# Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A MAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area. This network mainly uses FDDI, CDDI, and ATM as the technology with a range from 5km to 50km. Its transmission speed is average. It is difficult to maintain and it comes with a high cost. Examples of MAN are networking in towns, cities, a single large city, a large area within multiple buildings, etc.


 **Advantages of MAN**

• MAN offers high-speed connectivity in which the speed ranges from 10-100 Mbps.

• The security level in MAN is high and strict as compared to WAN.

• It support to transmit data in both directions concurrently because of dual bus architecture.

• MAN can serve multiple users at a time with the same high-speed internet to all the users.

• MAN allows for centralized management and control of the network, making it easier to monitor and manage network resources and security.


 **Disadvantages of MAN**

• The architecture of MAN is quite complicated hence, it is hard to design and maintain.

• This network is highly expensive because it required the high cost to set up fiber optics.

• It provides less fault tolerance.

• The Data transfer rate in MAN is low when compare to LANs.


# Wide Area Network (WAN)


WAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path. It is not restrained to a single location but extends over many locations. WAN can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other with a range above 50km. Here we use Leased-Line & Dial-up technology. Its transmission speed is very low and it comes with very high maintenance and very high cost. The most common example of WAN is the Internet.


 **Advantages of WAN**


• It covers large geographical area which enhances the reach of organisation to transmit data quickly and cheaply.

• The data can be stored in centralised manner because of remote access to data provided by WAN.

• The travel charges that are needed to cover the geographical area of work can be minimised.

• WAN enables a user or organisation to connect with the world very easily and allows to exchange data and do business at global level.


**Disadvantages of WAN**


• Traffic congestion in Wide Area Network is very high.

• The fault tolerance ability of WAN is very less.

• Noise and error are present in large amount due to multiple connection point.

• The data transfer rate is slow in comparison to LAN because of large distances and high number of connected system within the network.


# Network Security


Network security is the practice of protecting a computer network from unauthorized access, misuse, or attacks. It involves using tools, technologies, and policies to ensure that data traveling over the network is safe and secure, keeping sensitive information away from hackers and other threats.


# Types of Network Security


**Email Security**

Email Security is defined as the process designed to protect the Email Account and its contents safe from unauthorized access. For Example, you generally see, fraud emails are automatically sent to the Spam folder. because most email service providers have built-in features to protect the content. 


**Access Control**

Your network should not be accessible to every user. You need to identify every user and every device in order to keep out any attackers. You can then put your security policies into effect. Noncompliant endpoint devices might either have their access restricted or blocked. Network access control (NAC) is this process.


**Sandboxing**

Sandboxing is a cybersecurity technique in which files are opened or code is performed on a host computer that simulates end-user operating environments in a secure, isolated environment. To keep threats off the network, sandboxing watches the code or files as they are opened and searches for harmful activity.

**Web Security**

A online security solution will restrict access to harmful websites, stop web-based risks, and manage staff internet usage. Your web gateway will be safeguarded both locally and in the cloud. “Web security” also include the precautions you take to safeguard your personal website.


**Intrusion Prevention System(IPS)**

An intrusion Prevention System is also known as Intrusion Detection and Prevention System. It is a network security application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activity. The major functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, collect information about this activity, report it, and attempt to block or stop it.


**Antivirus and Anti-malware Software**

This type of network security ensures that any malicious software does not enter the network and jeopardize the security of the data. Malicious software like Viruses, Trojans, and Worms is handled by the same. This ensures that not only the entry of the malware is protected but also that the system is well-equipped to fight once it has entered. 


**Firewalls Security**

A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic. Before Firewalls, network security was performed by Access Control Lists (ACLs) residing on routers.


**Application Security**

Application security denotes the security precautionary measures utilized at the application level to prevent the stealing or capturing of data or code inside the application. It also includes the security measurements made during the advancement and design of applications, as well as techniques and methods for protecting the applications whenever.


**Wireless Security**

Wireless networks are less secure than wired ones. If not properly secured, setting up a wireless LAN can be like having Ethernet ports available everywhere, even in places like parking lots. To prevent attacks and keep your wireless network safe, you need dedicated products designed to protect it from exploits and unauthorized access.


**Mobile Device Security**

Cybercriminals are focusing more on mobile devices and apps. In the next three years, about 90 percent of IT organizations might allow corporate applications on personal mobile devices. It’s crucial to control which devices can connect to your network and set up their connections securely to protect network traffic from unauthorized access.
