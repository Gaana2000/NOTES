# GDPR

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  is legislation that updated and unified data privacy laws across the European Union (EU). The GDPR was approved by the European Parliament on April 14, 2016, and went into effect on May 25, 2018.

• It replaces the EU Data Protection Directive of 1995. The new directive focuses on keeping businesses more transparent and expanding the privacy rights of data subjects. When an organization detects a serious data breach, it's required by the GDPR to notify all affected people and the supervising authority within 72 hours. Mandates in the GDPR apply to all data produced by EU citizens, regardless of whether the company collecting the data in question is located within the EU, as well as all people whose data is stored within the EU, regardless of whether they're EU citizens. The GDPR also defines penalties for noncompliance.

• The purpose of the GDPR is to protect individuals and the data that describes them and to ensure the organizations that collect that data do so in a responsible manner. The GDPR also mandates that personal data is maintained safely; in part, the regulation says personal data must be protected against "unauthorized or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction or damage."

**Under the GDPR, companies can't legally process any person's personally identifiable information (PII) without meeting at least one of the following six conditions**

✓ Express consent of the data subject.

✓ Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to enter a contract.

✓ Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

✓ Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person.

✓ Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

✓ Processing is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject.


# What data does GDPR protect?

Users must give consent to any company or organization that wishes to collect and use personal data. As defined by the GDPR, personal data is information that relates to "an identified or identifiable natural person" -- referred to as a data subject.

**Personal data includes the following types of information**

•Name

•Identification number

•Location data

•Any information that is specific to "the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."

•Biometric data that's acquired through some form of technical process, such as facial imaging or fingerprinting.

•Information related to a person's health or healthcare.

•Racial or ethnic information of an individual.
Political opinions or religious beliefs.

•Union membership.


#  7 principles of GDPR


**Lawfulness, fairness and transparency** -  The data subject must be clearly informed about how their data will be used.


**Purpose limitation** - Data can be collected only for specific purposes.


**Data minimization** - The amount of data collected is limited to what is necessary for specific processing.


**Accuracy** -  Organizations collecting data must ensure its accuracy and update it as necessary. Data must be deleted or changed when a data subject makes such a request.


**Storage limitation** - Collected data won't be retained longer than needed.


**Integrity and confidentiality** -  Appropriate protection measures must be applied to personal data to ensure it's secure and protected against theft or unauthorized use.


**Accountability** - Data collectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.


# HIPAA 

**The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** enacted in 1996 is a set of regulatory standards that aims at safeguarding sensitive patient data from healthcare providers. HIPAA compliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the provisions of the Act are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). 

* A PHI encompasses information such as patient details, electronic records, medical records, Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and more. The OCR investigates HIPAA violations that compromise the integrity of protected health information (PHI) and levies appropriate fines based on a tiered structure. 


# What is HIPAA compliance?

HIPAA compliance is a process for covered entities and business associates to protect and secure PHI according to the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.

**The key goals and objectives of HIPAA are**

* Ensuring the privacy of health information

* Securing electronic health records

* Simplifying administrative processes

* Improving insurance portability

* A patient’s health information often includes their family medical history and financial details, making it essential to keep it secure. This is why HIPAA certification was introduced.



# PCI DSS  [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards]

PCI DSS is the global security standard for all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. PCI DSS sets a baseline level of protection for consumers and helps reduce fraud and data breaches across the entire payment ecosystem. It is applicable to any organisation that accepts or processes payment cards.


**PCI DSS compliance involves three main components**

**Handling card Data** - Handling the ingress of credit card data from customers; namely, that sensitive card details are collected and transmitted securely.


**Storing data securely** - which is outlined in the 12 security domains of the PCI standard, such as encryption, ongoing monitoring and security testing of access to card data.

**Annual Validation**
Validating annually that the required security controls are in place, which can include forms, questionnaires, external vulnerability scanning services and third-party audits.


**The 12 requirements of PCI DSS are**

* Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.

* Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.

* Protect stored cardholder data.

* Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

* Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs.

* Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

* Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know.

* Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.

* Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

* Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.

* Regularly test security systems and processes.

* Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.
