# WEBSECURITY

**WEBSECURITY** is a broad category of security solutions that protect your users, devices, and wider network against internet-based cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to breaches and data loss. It reduces the security risk to your organization when your users accidentally access malicious files and websites through some combination of firewall inspection, intrusion prevention system (IPS) scanning, sandboxing, URL filtering, and various other security and access controls.

● The Purpose of WebSecurity is that the massive importance of the internet for modern enterprises—and the accompanying growth in the sophistication, frequency, and impact of cyberattacks—has made web security critical to business continuity. It’s your first line of defense against threats that can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, costly ransoms, reputational harm, compliance violations, and a host of other consequences.


# What Are the Benefits of Web Security?

For a modern enterprise, effective web security has broad technical and human benefits:

● Protect your business and stay compliant by preventing loss of sensitive data.

● Protect customers and employees by securing their private information.

● Avoid costly service interruptions by preventing infections and exploits.

● Offer a better user experience by helping your users stay safe and productive.

● Maintain customer loyalty and trust by staying secure and out of the news.

# What Does Web Security Protect Against?

Web security casts a wide net to protect users and endpoints from malicious emails, encrypted threats, malicious or compromised websites and databases, malicious redirects, hijacking, and more. 

**Ransomware**

These attacks encrypt data, and then demand a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key. In a double-extortion attack, your data is also exfiltrated.

**General malware**

  Countless variants of malware exist that can lead to anything from data leaks, spying, and unauthorized access to lockouts, errors, and system crashes.

**Phishing**

Often carried out through email, text messages, or malicious websites, these attacks trick users into things like divulging login credentials or downloading spyware.

**SQL injection**

These attacks exploit an input vulnerability in a database server, allowing an attacker to execute commands that let them retrieve, manipulate, or delete data.

**Denial of service (DoS)**

These attacks slow or even shut down a network device such as a server by sending it more data than it can process. In distributed DoS—that is, a DDoS attack—this is carried out by many hijacked devices at once.

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)**

In this type of injection attack, an attacker introduces malicious code to a trusted website by entering it in an unprotected user input field.

# How Does Web Security Work?

Web Security functions sit between your environment’s endpoints and the internet. From there, they inspect traffic and requests traveling in both directions. No single technology monitors or inspects all traffic, but a “stack” of appliances—or a cloud-delivered platform of services, more effective today—provides holistic coverage to prevent policy violations, malware infections, data loss, credential theft, and so on.
Many solutions are available today, and some are more comprehensive than others. In a full stack, web security includes the following technologies:

**Secure web gateway (SWG)**  provides threat protection and policy enforcement for users accessing the web to prevent infections and block unwanted traffic.

**Firewall/IPS**  provides network security, app control, and visibility. Cloud firewalls stay up to date and scale to handle demand or encryption, making them a more practical option.
 
 **URL filtering**   screens and blocks inappropriate access or content, also offering protection from web-borne malware.
 
**Sandboxing** isolates software in an environment where it can be scanned and executed without the risk of infecting a system or other applications.

**Browser isolation** loads webpages or apps in a remote browser and only sends the user pixels, preventing the downloading, copying, pasting, and printing of data or documents.

**DNS controls** define rules that control requests and responses related to DNS traffic, allowing you to detect and prevent DNS abuses such as tunneling.

**Antivirus** detects and neutralizes trojans, spyware, ransomware, and more. Many offerings also protect against threats such as malicious URLs, phishing, and DDoS.

**TLS/SSL** decryption breaks open inbound and outbound encrypted traffic to inspect its contents, and then re-encrypts it to continue to its destination.....
