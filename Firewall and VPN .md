# FIREWALLS

• A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic.

• **Accept** -  Allow the traffic

• **Reject** -  block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error”

• **Drop** -  block the traffic with no reply

• A firewall can be defined as a special type of network security device or a software program that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a defined set of security rules. It acts as a barrier between internal private networks and external sources (such as the public Internet).

• The primary purpose of a firewall is to allow non-threatening traffic and prevent malicious or unwanted data traffic for protecting the computer from viruses and attacks. A firewall is a cybersecurity tool that filters network traffic and helps users block malicious software from accessing the Internet in infected computers.


# Why Use Firewall ?

• Firewalls are primarily used to prevent malware and network-based attacks. Additionally, they can help in blocking application-layer attacks. These firewalls act as a gatekeeper or a barrier. They monitor every attempt between our computer and another network. They do not allow data packets to be transferred through them unless the data is coming or going from a user-specified trusted source.

• Firewalls are designed in such a way that they can react quickly to detect and counter-attacks throughout the network. They can work with rules configured to protect the network and perform quick assessments to find any suspicious activity. In short, we can point to the firewall as a traffic controller.

• Open Access, Lost or Comprised Data, and Network Crashes.


# How does a firewall work?

A firewall system analyzes network traffic based on pre-defined rules. It then filters the traffic and prevents any such traffic coming from unreliable or suspicious sources. It only allows incoming traffic that is configured to accept.
Typically, firewalls intercept network traffic at a computer's entry point, known as a port. Firewalls perform this task by allowing or blocking specific data packets (units of communication transferred over a digital network) based on pre-defined security rules. Incoming traffic is allowed only through trusted IP addresses, or sources.


# Functions of Firewall

• Network Threat Prevention

• Application and Identity-Based Control

• Hybrid Cloud Support

• Scalable Performance

• Network Traffic Management and Control

• Access Validation

• Record and Report on Events


# Limitations of Firewall

• Firewalls cannot prevent misuse of passwords.

• Firewalls cannot secure the system which is already infected.

• Firewalls cannot protect if security rules are misconfigured.

• Firewalls cannot stop users from accessing malicious websites, making it vulnerable to internal threats or attacks.


# VPN ( Virtual Private Network )

A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. A Virtual Private Network is a way to extend a private network using a public network such as the Internet. The name only suggests that it is a “Virtual Private Network”, i.e. user can be part of a local network sitting at a remote location. It makes use of tuneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

# VPN Protocols

1. **OpenVPN** 

A cryptographic protocol that prioritises security is called OpenVPN. OpenVPN is compatible protocol that provides a variety of setup choices.

2. **Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol(PPTP)**

PPTP is not utilized because there are many other secure choices with higher and more advanced encryption that protect data.

3. **WireGuard**

Wireguard is a good choice that indicates capability in terms of performance.

4. **Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol(SSTP)** 

SSTP is developed for Windows users by Microsoft. It is not widely used due to the lack of connectivity.

5. **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol(L2TP)**

It connects a user to the VPN server but lacks encryption hence it is frequently used with IPSec to offer connection, encryption, and security simultaneously.


# Why Should Use VPN?

1. **For Unlimited Streaming**

Love streaming your favourite shows and sports games,A VPN is your ultimate companion for unlocking streaming services.

2. **For elevating your Gaming Experience**

Unleash your gaming potential with the added layer of security and convenience provided by a VPN. Defend yourself against vengeful competitors aiming to disrupt your gameplay while improving your ping for smoother, lag-free sessions. Additionally, gain access to exclusive games that may be restricted in your region, opening up a world of endless gaming possibilities.

3. **For Anonymous Torrenting**

When it comes to downloading copyrighted content through torrenting, it’s essential to keep your IP address hidden. A VPN can mask your identity and avoid potential exposure, ensuring a safe and private torrenting experience.

4. **For supercharging your Internet Speed**

Are you tired of your Internet speed slowing down when downloading large files, Your
Internet Service Provider (ISP)
might be intentionally throttling your bandwidth. Thankfully, a VPN can rescue you by keeping your online activities anonymous, effectively preventing ISP throttling. Say goodbye to sluggish connections and embrace blazing-fast speeds.

5. **Securing Public Wi-Fi**

VPNs are essential for maintaining security when using public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in coffee shops, airports, or hotels. These networks are often vulnerable to cyberattacks, and using a VPN encrypts your internet connection, protecting your data from potential hackers and eavesdroppers when you connect to untrusted Wi-Fi hotspots.

# Benefits of VPN

• When you use VPN it is possible to switch IP.

• The internet connection is safe and encrypted with VPN

• Sharing files is confidential and secure.

• Your privacy is protected when using the internet.

• There is no longer a bandwidth restriction.
It facilitates cost savings for internet shopping.

# Limitations of VPN

• VPN may decrease your internet speed.

• Premium VPNs are not cheap.

• VPN usage may be banned in some nations.
